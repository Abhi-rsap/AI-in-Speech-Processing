# Telugu Dialect Classification
This is a project which classifies a given telugu speech audio input into one of the three dialects:
1. Coastal
2. Rayalaseema
3. Telangana

# Data Creation
The dataset was created solely by myself, taking around 30 samples of common telugu dialect speech in each of the dialects.
